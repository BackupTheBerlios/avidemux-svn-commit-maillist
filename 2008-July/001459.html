-Basic Installation
-==================
-
-   These are generic installation instructions.
-
-   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
-various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
-those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
-It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
-definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
-`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
-reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
-(useful mainly for debugging `configure').
-
-   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
-to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
-diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
-contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
-called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
-it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.
-
-The simplest way to compile this package is:
-
-  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
-     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
-     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
-     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
-     `configure' itself.
-
-     Running `configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
-     messages telling which features it is checking for.
-
-  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
-
-  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.
-
-  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  
-
-Compilers and Options
-=====================
-
-   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
-initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
-a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
-this:
-     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
-
-Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
-     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
-
-Compiling For Multiple Architectures
-====================================
-
-   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
-same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
-supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
-directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.
-
-   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
-variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
-in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
-one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
-architecture.
-
-Installation Names
-==================
-
-   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
-`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
-installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
-option `--prefix=PATH'.
-
-   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
-architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
-PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
-
-   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
-with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
-option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
-
-Optional Features
+Building Avidemux
 =================
 
-   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
-`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
-is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
-`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
-package recognizes.
+Avidemux uses CMake (www.cmake.org) to manage its build process.  CMake is a 
+cross-platform, open-source build system that generates native makefiles and 
+workspaces for the compiler environment of your choice.
 
-   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
-find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
-you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
-`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
+This document explains briefly how to build Avidemux with CMake:
 
-Specifying the System Type
-==========================
+-	Change to the top-level directory containing the Avidemux sources:
+        cd avidemux_src
+-	Create a directory, e.g. &quot;build&quot;, and change into it:
+        mkdir build
+        cd build
+-	Use CMake to generate makefiles:
+        cmake ..
+-	Build Avidemux and install it:
+        make
+        make install
 
-   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
-automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
-will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
-a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
-`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
-type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
-     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
+Avidemux is installed to the directory relative to the installation prefix, 
+which can be set by adding the following flag to the cmake command:
+    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=&lt;dir&gt;
 
-See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
-`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
-need to know the host type.
+By default a release build is created.  To perform a debug build, add the 
+following flag to the cmake command:
+    &#150;DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 
-   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
-use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
-produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
-system on which you are compiling the package.
+The default makefile generator may need to be overridden on some systems.  To 
+do so, add one of the following flags to the cmake command:
+    For MSYS:
+        -G&quot;MSYS Makefiles&quot;
 
-Sharing Defaults
-================
+    For MinGW:
+        -G&quot;MinGW Makefiles&quot;
 
-   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
-you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
-default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
-`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
-`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
-`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
-A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
+    For Code::Blocks (requires CMake 2.6 or later):
+        -G&quot;CodeBlocks &#150; Unix Makefiles&quot;   or
+        -G&quot;CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles&quot;
 
-Operation Controls
-==================
+    For Eclipse (requires CMake 2.6 or later):
+        -G&quot;Eclipse CDT4 &#150; Unix Makefiles&quot;   or
+        -G&quot;Eclipse CDT4 &#150; MinGW Makefiles&quot;
 
-   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
-operates.
+An example cmake command:
+    cmake &#150;G&quot;CodeBlocks &#150; Unix Makefiles&quot; &#150;DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
 
-`--cache-file=FILE'
-     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
-     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
-     debugging `configure'.
+In order to force CMake to perform every test again during the configuration 
+process, delete CMakeCache.txt.
 
-`--help'
-     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.
-
-`--quiet'
-`--silent'
-`-q'
-     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.
-
-`--srcdir=DIR'
-     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
-     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
-
-`--version'
-     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
-     script, and exit.
-
-`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
-
+Use the console GUI named ccmake on Unix or the CMake GUI on Microsoft Windows 
+to discover other available options.
