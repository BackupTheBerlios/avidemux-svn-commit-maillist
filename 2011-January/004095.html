+		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+		       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
+ numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
+
+  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
+specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
+other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
+your libraries, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
+you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
+code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
+complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
+with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
+the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
+permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
+
+  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
+version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
+the original authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
+software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
+transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
+we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
+free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
+GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
+license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
+designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
+one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
+the same as in the ordinary license.
+
+  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
+they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
+program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
+changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
+analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
+a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
+derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
+treats it as such.
+
+  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
+Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
+sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
+concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
+
+  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
+users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
+libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
+permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
+preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
+libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
+this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
+changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
+will lead to faster development of free libraries.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
+&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
+former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
+works together with the library.
+
+  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
+General Public License rather than by this special one.
+
+		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
+contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
+party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
+General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is
+addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
+
+  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
+
+  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
+which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
+Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
+included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
+
+  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
+and installation of the library.
+
+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
+and what the program that uses the Library does.
+  
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
+Library.
+
+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
+fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
+
+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+    its purpose remains meaningful.
+
+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+    root function must still compute square roots.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
+it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Library.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+these notices.
+
+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+
+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+the Library into a program that is not a library.
+
+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+medium customarily used for software interchange.
+
+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
+
+  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
+library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
+
+  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+
+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+
+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+
+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
+link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+engineering for debugging such modifications.
+
+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+of these things:
+
+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
+    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+    to use the modified definitions.)
+
+    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
+    least three years, to give the same user the materials
+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
+    than the cost of performing this distribution.
+
+    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+    specified materials from the same place.
+
+    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+
+  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
+Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
+distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+the executable.
+
+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+distribute.
+
+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
+
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+    Sections above.
+
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+
+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Library or works based on it.
+
+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
+written in the body of this License.
+
+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free

+1 Overview
+**********
+
+The documented and supported method to build MP4v2 uses the GNU build
+system (also known as the Autotools). You must first obtain the sources
+by either downloading and extracting the source-distribution bundle or
+working directly MP4v2's Subversion repository. We have build documents
+for both methods, but unless you are a member of the MP4v2 project, you
+are strongly encouraged to use the source-distribution method.
+
+On other supported platforms which lack Autotools we provide an
+alternative method for building the software. Please see the
+appropriate platform section.
+
+2 Introduction
+**************
+
+This document describes the recommended process to build MP4v2 from the
+repository. This process is a superset of the process to build from a
+source-distribution bundle.  If you are interested in building from a
+source-distribution bundle then this document is not for you.
+
+3 Quickstart
+************
+
+This chapter is for the impatient or those just looking for a quick
+summary of all the commands used in a typical build. You may skip this
+summary and jump to *note Build Process::.
+
+     svn checkout <A HREF="https://mp4v2.googlecode.com/svn/releases/1.9.1">https://mp4v2.googlecode.com/svn/releases/1.9.1</A> mp4v2
+     cd mp4v2
+     autoreconf -fiv
+     rm -fr build/
+     mkdir build/
+     cd build/
+     ../configure
+     make
+     make install
+     make install-man
+     make dist
+
+4 Build Process
+***************
+
+4.1 Checkout Sources
+====================
+
+Checkout sources from the project's Subversion repository.
+
+Sources are checked out from either the trunk, release or a branch.
+This document was generated from one of those, and for example
+purposes, we will use exactly the same URL which used to create the
+distribution which contains this document.
+
+If you are a project member, then you may add the appropriate
+login/password information as needed.
+
+     svn checkout <A HREF="https://mp4v2.googlecode.com/svn/releases/1.9.1">https://mp4v2.googlecode.com/svn/releases/1.9.1</A> mp4v2
+     cd mp4v2
+
+It is recommended to use Subversion 1.5.0 or higher.  Lower versions
+might work.
+
+4.2 Boostrap (Autotools)
+========================
+
+The following command causes forces Autotools to regenerate all files
+and install helper scripts needed at configure-time and to regenerate
+all files.
+
+     autoreconf -fiv
+
+If you are a project member and preparing for a release, it is
+important to note that the versions of Autotools available in your path
+will directly effect files added to the bundle. At the time of writing,
+the following versions of Autotools are recommended; in some cases a
+minimum is hard-coded and warnings will be issued if in violation:
+
+   * GNU autoconf 2.61 or higher (lower versions might work)
+
+   * GNU automake 1.10 or higher (lower versions might work)
+
+   * GNU libtool 1.5.26 or higher (lower versions might work)
+
+4.3 Configure
+=============
+
+The following command configures the project for a build.  It is highly
+recommended that you invoke configure from an empty directory.
+
+     rm -fr build/
+     mkdir build/
+     cd build/
+     ../configure
+
+Please see `INSTALL' for details on configure usage, and standard
+options. Additionally, the following custom options have been added to
+`configure':
+
+`--disable-debug'
+     Do not generate debug information.  Do not direct compiler to
+     generate debugging information. By default the compiler will
+     generate debug information if the platform supports it.
+
+`--disable-optimize'
+     Do not optimize. Do not direct compiler to optimize code. By
+     default compiler optimization is enabled if the platform supports
+     it.
+
+`--disable-fvisibility'
+     Do not set default ELF symbol visibility. By default configure
+     attempts to detect if the compiler supports this feature. However
+     on some platforms detecting incompatibilty of this feature might
+     not be accurate in which case this option should be given.
+
+`--disable-gch'
+     By default certain platforms are marked to use GCC precompiled
+     headers. Generally this greatly decrease build times but may
+     require more diligence for iterative development; that is to say
+     dependencies may not properly be tracked and more frequent `make
+     clean' may be required when headers are changed. Use this option
+     to disable GCC precompiled headers.
+
+`--disable-largefile'
+     On some 32-bit platforms or configurations it might be desirable
+     to build without largefile (LFS) support. By default configure
+     attempts to detect formal LFS support and enables it if found.
+
+`--disable-util'
+     Do not build/install utilities. This is convenience option for
+     users who desire to skip building the utilities (eg. command-line
+     executables) which are enabled by default.
+
+`--enable-bi=ARCH'
+     On bi-arch capable platforms it is possible to generate 32 or 64
+     bit code. This is supported by adding arguments `-m32' or `-m64',
+     respectively, when compiling or linking. Use this option to
+     override the platform-specific default.
+
+`--enable-ub[=ARCHS]'
+     On OSX systems it is possible to generate universal binaries. This
+     is supported by adding one or more argument patterns `-arch ARCH'
+     when compiling or linking. Use this option to either target an
+     architecture different from the platform default, or to produce
+     universal binaries.
+
+`--enable-dependency-tracking'
+     Enable automatic dependency tracking for include-files. By default
+     this feature is disabled.
+
+
+4.4 Build
+=========
+
+The following command will build MP4v2.
+
+     make
+
+On some platforms `make' refers to a BSD-flavor of make which is not
+compatible with this project. Check if `gmake' is installed, and if it
+is, substitute `gmake' wherever you may see `make' in this document.
+Otherwise you will need to install GNU make package version 3.81 or
+higher. Lower versions might work.
+
+4.5 Install
+===========
+
+The following command will install MP4v2.
+
+     make install
+     make install-man
+
+4.6 Create Distribution
+=======================
+
+The following command will create a MP4v2 source distribution. It is
+during this step that shipped documentation is generated.
+
+     make dist
+
+This step in the build process introduces additional requirements to
+the host system. While most of the following utilities are generally
+available, `help2man' is used to generate man-pages; however if this
+command is not available the man-pages will be empty. This is
+acceptable for non-release builds but for full quality builds this
+command is required.
+
+   * GNU help2man 1.36 or higher (lower versions should work)
+
+   * GNU tar 1.15.1 or higher (lower versions should work)
+
+   * GNU gzip 1.3.10 or higher (lower versions should work)
+
+   * bzip2 1.0.4 or higher (lower versions should work)
+
+   * Info-ZIP zip 2.32 or higher (lower versions should work)
+
+4.7 Build Documentation
+=======================
+
+This step in the build process introduces some significant requirements
+to the host system:
+
+   * GNU texinfo 4.8 or higher (lower versions should work)
+
+   * Doxygen 1.5.7 or higher (lower versions should work)
+
+Documentation that is shipped with source-distribution is generated as
+part of the *note Build Process:: step. This section documents builds
+all of the supported methods to build documentation. There are three
+kinds of documentation in this project; man-pages, articles and API.
+Documentation must be build from the repository.
+
+Man-pages are automatically generated for command-line utilities by
+using `html2man' which invokes standard options `--help' and
+`--version' and gleans the information, generating a man-page in nroff
+script. Note that the utilities will first be built as they are
+depdendencies of man-page generation.
+
+Artcles are usually hand-written and authored in Texinfo format which
+permits macro-expansions, simple formatting and conversion to several
+popular formats using the GNU `makeinfo'. A Texinfo manual
+(<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo">http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo</A>) is available.
+
+API is documented inline to C and C++ source files, usually headers
+using Doxygen comment-formatting. Doxygen is then used to post-process
+these files and generate documentation in various formats. A Doxygen
+manual is available at it's main site (<A HREF="http://www.doxygen.org">http://www.doxygen.org</A>) .
+
+The project's goal is to document as thoroughly as possible the public
+API in MP4v2. Since we never have enough time to document everything,
+we try to set some priorities in this regard. Generally the public API
+is the highest priority to document. Next most important is probably
+underlying utility code which is shared by many developers; for example
+libplatform.
+
+If you need examples of how to document C-compatible source see
+`include/mp4v2/mp4v2.h' and for C++-only source see
+`libplatform/io/File.h' .
+
+The following table describes the various make targets available for
+building docs. Note you must first have completed the *note Configure::
+step.
+
+`make man'
+     Generate man-pages for command-line utilities.
+
+`make html'
+     Generate articles in HTML format from `texi' files.
+
+`make txt'
+     Generate articles in plaintext format from `texi' files.
+
+`make wiki'
+     Generate articles in Google Code Wiki format from `texi' files.
+
+`make xml'
+     Generate articles in (Texinfo) XML format from `texi' files.
+
+`make api'
+     Generate API in HTML format from header files.
+
+`make articles'
+     Convenience; the equivalent of `make html txt wiki xml' .
+
+`make doc'
+     Convenience; the equivalent of `make man articles api' .
+
+
+And finally all of the document targets have a corresponding clean
+target which cleans up generated files. Simply prefix as follows:
+
+     make manclean
+     make htmlclean
+     make txtclean
+     make wikiclean
+     make xmlclean
+     make apiclean
+     make articlesclean
+     make docclean
+
+4.8 Post Site and API Documentation to project website.
+=======================================================
+
+This step is for project maintainers and can be used to update Site and
+API documentation. The following components are updated:
+
+   * Featured Wiki article: BuildRepository
+
+   * Featured Wiki article: BuildSource
+
+   * MP4v2 (trunk) docs (includes Release Notes and other articles, and
+     API docs).
+
+This procedure may only be run from a *nix platform and has only been
+tested on Mac OS X.
+
+`make google.clean'
+     Clean any local working copy of google changeset.
+
+`make google.post'
+     Generate required docs, sparse-checkout google tree, remove files
+     which are no longer generated, add new files which are generated,
+     and update existing files.
+
+`svn ci -m &quot;-refreshed GoogleCode site+api docs.&quot; google/.'
+     Check-in changes. This might take several minutes, especially if
+     your upstream bandwidth is limited.
+
+
+5 Platform Notes
+****************
+
+MP4v2 builds on many unix-style platforms, also commonly referred to as
+posix-style systems. Building on Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris,
+Cygwin, Windows are known to work.
+
+Similar platforms should also work. Please see the following platform
+specific notes for instructions on commonly used options for various
+platforms.
+
+5.1 Mac OS X
+============
+
+Building on Mac OS X is well supported as it is used by maintainers of
+this project. The following are the recommended specifications for this
+platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
+possible:
+
+   * Mac Intel hardware
+
+   * Mac OS X 10.5.7
+
+   * Xcode-3.1.2
+
+   * gcc 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)
+
+   * gcc 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5570)
+
+     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
+     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
+     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
+     requirements for your users. There are of course many valid
+     reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is
+     generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.
+
+5.1.1 Default Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
+without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
+static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.
+
+     ../configure
+
+5.1.2 Release Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
+which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
+configure:
+
+     ../configure --disable-debug
+
+5.1.3 Developer Binaries
+------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
+pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
+for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
+static libraries.
+
+     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static
+
+5.1.4 Universal Binaries - all architectures
+--------------------------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce universal binaries for all supported
+architectures is to pass the following option to configure. As of this
+writing, architectures { i386, x86_64, ppc, ppc64 } are built.
+
+     ../configure --enable-ub
+
+5.1.5 Universal Binaries - selected architectures
+-------------------------------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce universal binaries for selected
+architectures is to specify a comma-delimited list specifying the
+desired architecture identifiers. Passing the following option will
+produce universal binaries for architectures { i386, x86_64 }.
+
+     ../configure --enable-ub=i386,x86_64
+
+5.2 Linux
+=========
+
+Building on Linux is well supported as it is used by maintainers of
+this project. The following are the recommended specifications for this
+platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
+possible:
+
+   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
+
+   * Fedora 10, gcc 4.3.2
+
+   * gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work
+
+     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
+     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
+     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
+     requirements for your users. There are of course many valid
+     reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is
+     generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.
+
+5.2.1 Default Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
+without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
+static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.
+
+     ../configure
+
+5.2.2 Release Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
+which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
+configure:
+
+     ../configure --disable-debug
+
+5.2.3 Developer Binaries
+------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
+pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
+for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
+static libraries.
+
+     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static
+
+5.2.4 Bi-arch compilation
+-------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce a bi-arch binary is to specify the
+target (eg. 32-bit) with the following option to configure. This
+example will produce a 32-bit binary if compiling on a platform which
+defaults to producing 64-bit binaries. The inverse is also possible.
+
+     ../configure --enable-bi=32
+
+     Warning: Currently bi-arch cross-compilation is not supported due
+     to a bug with libtool which fails miserably during linking.
+
+5.3 FreeBSD
+===========
+
+Building on FreeBSD is supported. The following are the recommended
+specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only
+configuration that is possible:
+
+   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
+
+   * FreeBSD 7.0 Release, gcc 4.2.1
+
+   * gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work
+
+     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
+     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
+     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
+     requirements for your users. There are of course many valid
+     reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is
+     generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.
+
+5.3.1 Default Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
+without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
+static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.
+
+     ../configure
+
+5.3.2 Release Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
+which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
+configure:
+
+     ../configure --disable-debug
+
+5.3.3 Developer Binaries
+------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
+pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
+for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
+static libraries.
+
+     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static
+
+5.3.4 Bi-arch compilation
+-------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce a bi-arch binary is to specify the
+target (eg. 32-bit) with the following option to configure. This
+example will produce a 32-bit binary if compiling on a platform which
+defaults to producing 64-bit binaries. The inverse is also possible.
+
+     ../configure --enable-bi=32
+
+     Warning: Currently bi-arch cross-compilation is not supported due
+     to a bug with libtool which fails miserably during linking.
+
+5.4 Solaris
+===========
+
+Building on Solaris is supported. The following are the recommended
+specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only
+configuration that is possible:
+
+   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
+
+   * Solaris 10u6, gcc 3.4.3
+
+   * gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work
+
+     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
+     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
+     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
+     requirements for your users. There are of course many valid
+     reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is
+     generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.
+
+     Note: Solaris does not (yet) really bundle a compiler. The
+     recommendation is to use the companion-disk compiler for maximum
+     C++ runtime compatibility. It is usually found in `/usr/sfw/bin'.
+
+5.4.1 Default Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
+without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
+static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.
+
+     ../configure
+
+5.4.2 Release Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
+which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
+configure:
+
+     ../configure --disable-debug
+
+5.4.3 Developer Binaries
+------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
+pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
+for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
+static libraries.
+
+     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static
+
+5.4.4 Bi-arch compilation
+-------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce a bi-arch binary is to specify the
+target (eg. 32-bit) with the following option to configure. This
+example will produce a 32-bit binary if compiling on a platform which
+defaults to producing 64-bit binaries. The inverse is also possible.
+
+     ../configure --enable-bi=32
+
+     Warning: Currently bi-arch cross-compilation is not supported due
+     to a bug with libtool which fails miserably during linking.
+
+5.5 Cygwin
+==========
+
+Building on Cygwin is supported. The following are the recommended
+specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only
+configuration that is possible:
+
+   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
+
+   * Cygwin, gcc 4.3.2
+
+   * gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work
+
+     Note: As of this writing, Cygwin has available to it several
+     versions of gcc; only one of which may be found and used in the
+     path as `gcc' and `g++'. Configure will thus find what is probably
+     the older more stable version of gcc in a typical Cygwin
+     environment. If you desire to build with the newer gcc, it is
+     found in the path as `gcc-4' and `g++-4' respectively and you must
+     indicate to configure the desired versions. Defining the following
+     variables beforing running configure should do the trick:
+
+     setenv CC gcc-4
+     setenv CXX gcc-4
+     ../configure
+
+5.5.1 Default Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
+without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
+static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.
+
+     ../configure
+
+5.5.2 Release Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
+which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
+configure:
+
+     ../configure --disable-debug
+
+5.5.3 Developer Binaries
+------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
+pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
+for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
+static libraries.
+
+     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static
+
+5.6 Windows
+===========
+
+Native builds on Windows is supported via Microsoft's Visual Studio
+package. Both the commercial version and free version (express) are
+known to work. The following are the recommended specifications for
+this platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
+possible:
+
+   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
+
+   * Windows 2000 or higher, Visual Studio 9.0 (aka. Visual Studio 2008)
+
+   * Visual Studio 9.0 Express is reported to work
+
+Only 32-bit binaries are targeted, and win32-API is set to Windows 2000
+or higher. Older versions of Windows, or win32-API are not supported.
+
+MP4v2 has directory `vstudio9.0/' which contains the necessary
+solution+project files to produce a basic build of libmp4v2's DLL and
+several command-line executables. Enabling things such as debugging,
+optimization, etc, are all left as an exercise to the user.
+
+     Warning: Project meta-data is stored in header `project.h'. A
+     proper source distribution is built using autotools and generates
+     `TOP/include/mp4v2/project.h' correctly, which is then bundled
+     with our source distribution. This is adequate for building on the
+     Windows platform.
+
+     However, if you are building from the repository, be warned that
+     there is no method to automatically generate `project.h' on
+     Windows. Instead, we periodically checkin a copy of this file
+     (generated using autotools) as
+     `vstudio9.0/include/mp4v2/project.h' which may from time to time
+     get out of date. If it is significantly out of date, you should
+     find the latest source distribution and copy the `project.h' from
+     there.

+
+1 Overview
+**********
+
+The documented and supported method to build MP4v2 uses the GNU build
+system (also known as the Autotools). You must first obtain the sources
+by either downloading and extracting the source-distribution bundle or
+working directly MP4v2's Subversion repository. We have build documents
+for both methods, but unless you are a member of the MP4v2 project, you
+are strongly encouraged to use the source-distribution method.
+
+On other supported platforms which lack Autotools we provide an
+alternative method for building the software. Please see the
+appropriate platform section.
+
+2 Introduction
+**************
+
+This document describes the recommended process to build MP4v2 from a
+source-distribution bundle. This process is a subset of the process to
+build directly from the project's repository. If you are interested in
+building from the repository then this document is not for you.
+
+3 Quickstart
+************
+
+This chapter is for the impatient or those just looking for a quick
+summary of all the commands used in a typical build. You may skip this
+summary and jump to *note Build Process::.
+
+     tar xf mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.bz2
+     cd mp4v2-1.9.1/
+     rm -fr build/
+     mkdir build/
+     cd build/
+     ../configure
+     make
+     make install
+     make install-man
+
+4 Build Process
+***************
+
+4.1 Extract
+===========
+
+Extract sources from a source-distribution bundle. Releases are
+available from `<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2">http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2</A>' in the downloads
+(<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2/downloads/list</A>) section.
+
+     tar xf mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.bz2
+     cd mp4v2-1.9.1/
+
+Older versions of `tar' may not automatically uncompress the bundle, so
+you might have to either enter additional flags manually, or first
+decompress the bundle before extracting. Some possible command
+variations for uncompressing a `bz2' file:
+
+     tar xjf mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.bz2
+     bunzip2 -c mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
+     bzcat mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
+
+And for a `gz' file:
+
+     tar xzf mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.gz
+     gunzip -c mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.gz | tar xf -
+     gzcat mp4v2-1.9.1.tar.gz | tar xf -
+
+4.2 Configure
+=============
+
+The following command configures the project for a build.  It is highly
+recommended that you invoke configure from an empty directory.
+
+     rm -fr build/
+     mkdir build/
+     cd build/
+     ../configure
+
+Please see `INSTALL' for details on configure usage, and standard
+options. Additionally, the following custom options have been added to
+`configure':
+
+`--disable-debug'
+     Do not generate debug information.  Do not direct compiler to
+     generate debugging information. By default the compiler will
+     generate debug information if the platform supports it.
+
+`--disable-optimize'
+     Do not optimize. Do not direct compiler to optimize code. By
+     default compiler optimization is enabled if the platform supports
+     it.
+
+`--disable-fvisibility'
+     Do not set default ELF symbol visibility. By default configure
+     attempts to detect if the compiler supports this feature. However
+     on some platforms detecting incompatibilty of this feature might
+     not be accurate in which case this option should be given.
+
+`--disable-gch'
+     By default certain platforms are marked to use GCC precompiled
+     headers. Generally this greatly decrease build times but may
+     require more diligence for iterative development; that is to say
+     dependencies may not properly be tracked and more frequent `make
+     clean' may be required when headers are changed. Use this option
+     to disable GCC precompiled headers.
+
+`--disable-largefile'
+     On some 32-bit platforms or configurations it might be desirable
+     to build without largefile (LFS) support. By default configure
+     attempts to detect formal LFS support and enables it if found.
+
+`--disable-util'
+     Do not build/install utilities. This is convenience option for
+     users who desire to skip building the utilities (eg. command-line
+     executables) which are enabled by default.
+
+`--enable-bi=ARCH'
+     On bi-arch capable platforms it is possible to generate 32 or 64
+     bit code. This is supported by adding arguments `-m32' or `-m64',
+     respectively, when compiling or linking. Use this option to
+     override the platform-specific default.
+
+`--enable-ub[=ARCHS]'
+     On OSX systems it is possible to generate universal binaries. This
+     is supported by adding one or more argument patterns `-arch ARCH'
+     when compiling or linking. Use this option to either target an
+     architecture different from the platform default, or to produce
+     universal binaries.
+
+`--enable-dependency-tracking'
+     Enable automatic dependency tracking for include-files. By default
+     this feature is disabled.
+
+
+4.3 Build
+=========
+
+The following command will build MP4v2.
+
+     make
+
+On some platforms `make' refers to a BSD-flavor of make which is not
+compatible with this project. Check if `gmake' is installed, and if it
+is, substitute `gmake' wherever you may see `make' in this document.
+Otherwise you will need to install GNU make package version 3.81 or
+higher. Lower versions might work.
+
+4.4 Install
+===========
+
+The following command will install MP4v2.
+
+     make install
+     make install-man
+
+5 Platform Notes
+****************
+
+MP4v2 builds on many unix-style platforms, also commonly referred to as
+posix-style systems. Building on Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris,
+Cygwin, Windows are known to work.
+
+Similar platforms should also work. Please see the following platform
+specific notes for instructions on commonly used options for various
+platforms.
+
+5.1 Mac OS X
+============
+
+Building on Mac OS X is well supported as it is used by maintainers of
+this project. The following are the recommended specifications for this
+platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
+possible:
+
+   * Mac Intel hardware
+
+   * Mac OS X 10.5.7
+
+   * Xcode-3.1.2
+
+   * gcc 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)
+
+   * gcc 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5570)
+
+     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
+     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
+     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
+     requirements for your users. There are of course many valid
+     reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is
+     generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.
+
+5.1.1 Default Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
+without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
+static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.

+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
+which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
+configure:

+     ../configure --disable-debug
+
+5.1.3 Developer Binaries
+------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
+pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
+for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
+static libraries.
+
+     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static
+
+5.1.4 Universal Binaries - all architectures
+--------------------------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce universal binaries for all supported
+architectures is to pass the following option to configure. As of this
+writing, architectures { i386, x86_64, ppc, ppc64 } are built.
+
+     ../configure --enable-ub
+
+5.1.5 Universal Binaries - selected architectures
+-------------------------------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce universal binaries for selected
+architectures is to specify a comma-delimited list specifying the
+desired architecture identifiers. Passing the following option will
+produce universal binaries for architectures { i386, x86_64 }.
+
+     ../configure --enable-ub=i386,x86_64
+
+5.2 Linux
+=========
+
+Building on Linux is well supported as it is used by maintainers of
+this project. The following are the recommended specifications for this

+   * Fedora 10, gcc 4.3.2
+
+   * gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work
+
+     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled

+The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
+without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
+static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.
+
+     ../configure
+
+5.5.2 Release Binaries
+----------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
+which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
+configure:
+
+     ../configure --disable-debug
+
+5.5.3 Developer Binaries
+------------------------
+
+The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
+pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
+for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
+static libraries.
+
+     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static
+
+5.6 Windows
+===========
+
+Native builds on Windows is supported via Microsoft's Visual Studio
+package. Both the commercial version and free version (express) are
+known to work. The following are the recommended specifications for
+this platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
+possible:
+
+   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
+
+   * Windows 2000 or higher, Visual Studio 9.0 (aka. Visual Studio 2008)
+
+   * Visual Studio 9.0 Express is reported to work
+
+Only 32-bit binaries are targeted, and win32-API is set to Windows 2000
+or higher. Older versions of Windows, or win32-API are not supported.
+
+MP4v2 has directory `vstudio9.0/' which contains the necessary
+solution+project files to produce a basic build of libmp4v2's DLL and
+several command-line executables. Enabling things such as debugging,
+optimization, etc, are all left as an exercise to the user.
+
+     Warning: Project meta-data is stored in header `project.h'. A
+     proper source distribution is built using autotools and generates
+     `TOP/include/mp4v2/project.h' correctly, which is then bundled
+     with our source distribution. This is adequate for building on the
+     Windows platform.
+
+     However, if you are building from the repository, be warned that
+     there is no method to automatically generate `project.h' on
+     Windows. Instead, we periodically checkin a copy of this file
+     (generated using autotools) as
+     `vstudio9.0/include/mp4v2/project.h' which may from time to time
+     get out of date. If it is significantly out of date, you should
+     find the latest source distribution and copy the `project.h' from
+     there.

+
+1 What's New?
+*************
+
+Welcome! This is the inaugural release of MP4v2.
+
+This project's goal is to continue development of a C-library named
+`libmp4v2' which was once a part of the (now defunct) MPEG4IP project.
+That library, and some related command-line utilities were branched
+from MPEG4IP version 1.6.1 to seed this project, MP4v2.
+
+2 Breaking Changes
+******************
+
+2.1 Top-level header file
+=========================
+
+This release is nearly 100% API compatible with MPEG4IP, however there
+are some differences. Dependents of this library must now include the
+top-level public header file as follows. This is the only supported
+mechanism to include the library. We do not support attempts to include
+any sub-level header files; such files are private implementation
+details and their naming must not be relied upon.

+A.1 Version 1.9
+===============
+
+  1. Renamed public API top-level header to `&lt;mp4v2/mp4v2.h&gt;' and added
+     namespaces for implementation (private) symbols. Only public API
+     symbols are exported for dynamic (shared) or DLL libraries. All
+     other symbols are now private, notwithstanding static-library
+     usage.
+
+  2. Added initial AC3 support.
+
+  3. Added native Windows port. The port targets `WINVER 0x0500' which
+     is Windows 2000 or higher.

+
+
+1 Overview
+**********
+
+MP4v2 bundles several command-line tools which, in general, allow some
+basic manipulation of mp4 files which have been created by other means.
+They are not meant to be a complete solution to management of mp4 file
+structure.
+
+The following is a brief summary of the tools available and the
+functionality offered. Other tools may be packaged with the
+distribution but are not yet stable enough to even document. User
+beware.
+
+`mp4file'
+     Operates on the entire file with actions such as list (summary
+     information), optimization and ASCII dumps.
+
+`mp4track'
+     Operates on individual tracks with actions such as colr-box and
+     pasp-box manipulation.
+
+`mp4art'
+     Operates on iTunes Metadata Cover-art Boxes with actions such as
+     list, add, replace, remove and extraction of Cover-art images.
+
+2 Introduction
+**************
+
+The tools are invoked by their command-name, followed by one or more
+options, actions, parameters for actions, and finally one or more files
+on which the tool will operate. Options are specified in one of two
+ways; in short or long syntax. A short-syntax option is prefixed with
+exactly one dash while a long-syntax option is prefixed with exactly
+two dashes. Depending on the option, it may or may not expect an
+argument. Specifying an option which expects an argument usually
+follows either of the following patterns:
+
+     toolname --something value ...
+     toolname --something=value ...
+
+The rest of this guide will use the equals sign method.
+
+3 Common Options
+****************
+
+Many of the tools share a common set of options which. These common
+options usually have identically behaving short or long syntax. In some
+cases short-syntax differs from long-syntax in that it may not require
+an argument. This style is used sparingly and only when truly
+convenient. Even though it is common practice in many unix-style tools
+to permit optional arguments, the tools used in this project will tend
+to avoid that because it can create a great deal of confusion.
+
+The following is a list of common options available:
+
+`-y, --dryrun'
+     do not actually create or modify any files.  In situations where
+     the command will create new or modify existing files, specifying
+     this option will cause the tool to do as much as possible stopping
+     short of performing any actual writes. This is useful to guard
+     against user mistakes or unexpected behavior.
+
+`-k, --keepgoing'
+     continue batch processing even after errors.  When actions involve
+     multiple files or operations, the default behavior is to stop and
+     exit on the first error encountered. Specify this option if it is
+     desirable to record the error but continue processing.
+
+`-o, --overwrite'
+     overwrite existing files when creating.  In situations where a new
+     file will be created, the default behavior is to not overwrite a
+     file if it already exists. Use this option to allow overwriting.
+
+`-f, --force'
+     force overwrite even if file is read-only.  If overwriting is
+     enabled, file permissions may prevent writes. Specify this option
+     to try and overwrite the file anyways. This usually involves
+     deleting the file, then creating a new one.
+
+`-q, --quiet'
+     equivalent to -verbose 0.  Default behavior is to print a low
+     amount of informative information, usually one line of text per
+     action/file. Specify this option to omit normal messages. Errors
+     will still be reported.
+
+`-d, --debug NUM'
+     increase debug or long-option to set NUM.  File I/O with mp4 file
+     structures have special debug options available to users
+     interested in all the fine details. Default is level 1 . The
+     short-syntax is accumulative and takes no argument, while
+     long-syntax takes an argument. For exmaple, the following are
+     equivalent and would set level 3: `-dd' or `-d -d' or `--debug=3'.
+     The following levels are available:
+       0. supressed
+
+       1. add warnings and errors (default)
+
+       2. add table details
+
+       3. add implicits
+
+       4. everything
+
+`-v, --verbose NUM'
+     increase verbosity or long-option to set NUM.  Tool activity by
+     default will generally print one informative message per
+     action/file. Specify this option to change the default behavior.
+     The short-syntax is accumulative and takes no argument, while
+     long-syntax takes an argument.
+       0. warnings and errors
+
+       1. normal informative messages (default)
+
+       2. more informative messages
+
+       3. everything
+
+`-h, --help'
+     print brief help or long-option for extended help.  The
+     short-syntax will produce brief help. Specify the long-option for
+     more extensive help.
+
+`--version'
+     print version information and exit.  Extended version information
+     used for SCM purposes is not listed in help, but is available by
+     specifying `--verionx'.
+
+4 mp4file
+*********
+
+`--list'
+     list (summary information).  This will produce brief report when
+     summarizing each mp4 file.  BRAND shows the file's main brand
+     identifier.  COMPAT shows additional brands for which the file
+     purports to be comaptible with.  SIZING displays if the file has
+     64-bit extensions of any kind, otherwise 32-bit.  Example output:
+          BRAND  COMPAT              SIZING  FILE
+          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+          M4A    M4A,isom,mp42       32-bit  Song.m4a
+          mp42   isom,mp42           32-bit  Movie1.m4v
+          mp42   isom,mp42           32-bit  Movie2.m4v
+
+`--optimize'
+     optimize mp4 structure.  This will rewrite the entire mp4 file
+     which, if needed, will clean up any unused (free) sections, and
+     re-order the atoms in a manner somewhat consistent with the
+     best-practices described in the ISO base media file specification.
+
+`--dump'
+     dump mp4 structure in human-readable format.  An ASCII dump of mp4
+     atoms is printed to stdout. This action is heavily influenced by
+     `--debug' option.
+
+     Example, list some files:
+          mp4file --list *.mp4 *.m4a *.m4v
+
+     Example, dump a file with more than usual debugging information:
+          mp4file -dd --dump movie.m4v
+
+5 mp4track
+**********
+
+This tool is used to manage various aspects of individual tracks in an
+mp4 file. Some of the actions are mp4 (generic) while others may
+support standards based on mp4 files such as `.m4a' or `.m4v' files.
+Each action has an appropriate scope upon which it acts. See individual
+actions for details. The following parameters are used to set scopes
+for actions:
+
+`--track-any'
+     act on any/all tracks.
+
+`--track-index IDX'
+     act on a single track specified by index value.  A track index is
+     0-based and counts upwards for each track available.
+
+`--track-id ID'
+     act on a single track specified by id value.  A track id is a
+     unique value assigned to each track and never changes.
+
+The list action will produce a brief report of each track for each mp4
+file.  Many (but not all) of the values shown may be modified by
+actions documented later in this article.  This will produce a brief
+report of each track for each mp4 file.
+
+`--list'
+     list all tracks in mp4.  Example output:
+          track[0] id=1
+            type           = video
+            enabled        = true
+            inMovie        = false
+            inPreview      = false
+            layer          = 0
+            alternateGroup = 0
+            volume         = 0.0000
+            width          = 850.96295166
+            height         = 360.00000000
+            language       = UNDEFINED(0)
+            handlerName    =
+            userDataName   = &lt;absent&gt;
+
+The following group of actions are used to modify the values shown by
+-list action. The modification of these values should be done with
+great care on any files, and as always you are cautioned to backup your
+media files before modification.
+
+`--enabled BOOL'
+     set trak.tkhd.flags (enabled bit).  When true indicates the track
+     is enabled.
+
+`--inmovie BOOL'
+     set trak.tkhd.flags (inMovie bit).  When true indicates the track
+     is used in the movie.
+
+`--inpreview BOOL'
+     set trak.tkhd.flags (inPreview bit).  When true indicates the
+     track is used in the movie's preview.
+
+`--layer NUM'
+     set trak.tkhd.layer.  Specifies the front-to-back ordering of
+     video tracks; tracks with lower numbers are closer to the viewer.
+     0 is the normal value, and -1 would be in front of track 0, and so
+     on.
+
+`--altgroup NUM'
+     set trak.tkhd.alternate_group.  An integer that specifies a group
+     or collection of tracks. If this field is 0 there is no
+     information on possible relations to other tracks. If this field
+     is not 0, it should be the same for tracks that contain alternate
+     data for one another and different for tracks belonging to
+     different such groups. Only one track within an alternate group
+     should be played or streamed at any one time, and must be
+     distinguishable from other tracks in the group via attributes such
+     as bitrate, codec, language, packet size etc. A group may have
+     only one member.
+
+`--volume FLOAT'
+     set trak.tkhd.volume.  Specifies the track's relative audio
+     volume. Full volume is 1.0 and is the normal value.
+
+`--width FLOAT'
+     set trak.tkhd.width.  Specifies the track's visual presentation
+     width. By default this is the same as the pixel width of the
+     images. All images in the sequence are scaled to this size before
+     any overall transformation by the matrix.
+
+`--height FLOAT'
+     set trak.tkhd.height.  Specifies the track's visual presentation
+     height. By default this is the same as the pixel width of the
+     images. All images in the sequence are scaled to this size before
+     any overall transformation by the matrix.
+
+`--language CODE'
+     set trak.mdia.mdhd.language.  Specifies the ISO-639-2/T langauge
+     code of the track. For example, `eng' for English, `fra' for
+     French.
+
+`--hdlrname STR'
+     set trak.mdia.hdlr.name.  Specifies a human-readable track type
+     (for debugging and inspection purposes).
+
+`--udtaname STR'
+     set trak.udta.name.value.  Specifies an arbitrary track-name. This
+     value is optional (may be absent).
+
+`--udtaname-remove'
+     remove trak.udta.name atom.  This action will remove the optional
+     atom.
+
+
+The colr related actions manage Color Parameter boxes which are used by
+QuickTime to map numerical values of pixels in a file to a common
+representation of color for video tracks. They may or may not be
+suitable for other Apple media players. Community feedback on
+compatibility is welcome.
+
+`--colr-list'
+     list all colr-boxes in mp4.
+
+`--colr-add'
+     add colr-box to a video track.  An individual track must be
+     specified.
+
+`--colr-set'
+     set colr-box parms.  An individual track must be specified.
+
+`--colr-remove'
+     remove colr-box from track.  By default all colr-boxes will be
+     removed unless an individual track is specified.
+
+`--colr-parms CSV'
+     where CSV is IDX1,IDX2,IDX3 .  Specify the exact parameters of an
+     NCLC Color Parameter box as specified in the QuickTime
+     specification.  IDX1 correlates to the 16-bit primaries index.
+     IDX2 correlates to the 16-bit transferFunction index.  IDX3
+     correlates to the 16-bit matrixIndex index.  Effects actions
+     -colr-add, -colr-set.
+
+`--colr-parm-hd'
+     equivalent to -colr-parms=1,1,1 .  This is a convenience setting
+     generally suitable for HD content.  Effects actions -colr-add,
+     -colr-set.
+
+`--colr-parm-sd'
+     equivalent to -colr-parms=6,1,6 .  This is a convenience setting
+     generally suitable for SD content.  Effects actions -colr-add,
+     -colr-set.
+
+     Example, add a colr-box tuned for HD content:
+          mp4track --track-id=1 --colr-add --colr-parm-hd mymovie.m4v
+
+     Example, add a colr-box with arbitrary index parameters:
+          mp4track --track-id=1 --colr-add --colr-parms=2,3,4 mymovie.m4v
+
+
+The pasp related actions manage Picture Aspect Ratio boxes which are
+used by QuickTime to specify height-to-width ratio of pixels for video
+tracks. They may or may not be suitable for other Apple media players.
+Community feedback on compatibility is welcome.
+
+`--pasp-list'
+     list all pasp-boxes in mp4.
+
+`--pasp-add'
+     add pasp-box to a video track.  An individual track must be
+     specified.
+
+`--pasp-set'
+     set pasp-box parms.  An individual track must be specified.
+
+`--pasp-remove'
+     remove pasp-box from track By default all pasp-boxes will be
+     removed unless an individual track is specified.
+
+`--pasp-parms CSV'
+     where CSV is hSPACING,vSPACING.  Specify the exact parameters of
+     Picture Aspect Ratio box as specified in the QuickTime
+     specification.  Effects actions -pasp-add, -pasp-set.
+
+     Example, add a pasp-box with default (1,1) parameters for square
+     pixels:
+          mp4track --track-id=1 --pasp-add --pasp-parms=1,1 mymovie.m4v
+
+     Example, add a pasp-box for 16:9 digital 525 (NTSC):
+          mp4track --track-id=1 --pasp-add --pasp-parms=40,33 mymovie.m4v
+
+     Example, add a pasp-box for 16:9 digital 625 (PAL):
+          mp4track --track-id=1 --pasp-add --pasp-parms=118,81 mymovie.m4v
+
+
+6 mp4art
+********
+
+This tool is used to manage iTunes Metadata Cover-art which is
+typically used to embed an image to a song file. For example, the songs
+in an album collection might all contain an image of the album cover
+art. This data is usually found in `.m4a', `.m4v' and `.mov' files.
+
+`--art-any'
+     act on all covr-boxes (default).  Specifies the scope of the
+     action to operate on all, if applicable, covr-boxes.
+
+`--art-index IDX'
+     act on covr-box index IDX.  Specifies the scope of the action to
+     operate on single covr-box INDEX.
+
+`--list'
+     list all covr-boxes.
+          IDX     BYTES  CRC32     TYPE       FILE
